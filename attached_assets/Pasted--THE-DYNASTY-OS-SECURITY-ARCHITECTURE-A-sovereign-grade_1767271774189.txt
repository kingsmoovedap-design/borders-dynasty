🔱 THE DYNASTY OS SECURITY ARCHITECTURE
A sovereign-grade security model for a global logistics empire
The Dynasty OS uses a multi‑layered, zero‑trust, event‑anchored security model designed for:

global logistics

financial operations

compliance

multi‑mode dispatch

driver/courier networks

Codex audit trails

1. Identity & Access Layer
Zero‑trust identity

Role-based access (Shipper, Driver, Ops, Admin, Omega)

Multi-factor authentication for Ops/Admin

API keys for enterprise shippers

Session isolation per region

2. Network & Perimeter Layer
Region‑segmented network zones

Mode‑segmented microservices (GROUND, AIR, OCEAN, COURIER)

API gateway with rate limiting

Encrypted tunnels for partner integrations

3. Data Security Layer
Encryption at rest + in transit

Field‑level encryption for sensitive data

Immutable Codex ledger for all events

Redundant multi‑region backups

Data residency controls (EU, US, APAC)

4. Application Security Layer
Input validation

Permission checks on every endpoint

Dispatch override logging

Driver event validation

Treasury transaction verification

5. Operational Security Layer
Region activation kill switches

Mode activation kill switches

Node isolation (city/airport/port)

Exception escalation workflows

Ops audit dashboards

6. Codex Security Layer (The Spine)
Every action is logged as a Codex event:

LOAD_CREATED

DISPATCH_SUGGESTED

DISPATCH_OVERRIDE

DRIVER_EVENT

TREASURY_PAYOUT

CREDIT_EVENT

REGION_ACTIVATED

MODE_ACTIVATED

Codex ensures:

tamper‑proof history

legal defensibility

compliance proof

forensic traceability

7. AI Security Layer
AI suggestions are logged

Overrides require reason codes

AI cannot auto‑assign without human approval

AI models trained only on anonymized operational data
