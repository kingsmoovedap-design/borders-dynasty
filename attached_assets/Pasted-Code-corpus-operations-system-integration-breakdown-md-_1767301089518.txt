# Dynasty OS — System Integration Breakdown
## How the Load Board, Dispatch Engine, Driver App, and Frontend Work Together

This document explains how the four core components of the Dynasty OS interact to form a unified logistics operating system. It describes the data flow, event flow, and system responsibilities across the platform.

---

# 1. System Overview

The Dynasty OS is composed of four primary operational components:

1. **Load Board** — Shipper and Ops interface for load creation and management  
2. **Dispatch Engine** — AI + human hybrid assignment system  
3. **Driver App** — Execution layer for drivers and couriers  
4. **Frontend / Web Console** — Unified UI for shippers, ops, dispatch, and admin  

All components communicate through:

- Dynasty OS API  
- Codex Event Logging  
- Treasury & Compliance Services  

Together, they form a closed operational loop:

Load → Dispatch → Driver → Delivery → Treasury → Codex → AI → Load

# 2. Load Board (Shippers + Ops)

### Purpose
The Load Board is the operational hub for creating, viewing, and managing loads.

### Key Functions
- Create new loads  
- View available loads  
- Filter by mode, region, status  
- View compliance flags  
- Trigger dispatch suggestions  

### Data Flow
1. Shipper creates a load → `/loads`  
2. Load appears on Load Board  
3. Ops requests AI dispatch suggestion  
4. Codex logs: `LOAD_CREATED`, `LOAD_UPDATED`

---

# 3. Dispatch Engine (AI + Human)

### Purpose
Assign the best driver or courier to each load.

### Key Functions
- AI scoring  
- Eligibility filtering  
- Backup driver suggestions  
- Manual override  
- Assignment confirmation  

### Dispatch Flow
1. Load Board triggers AI suggestion  
2. AI returns:
   - primary driver  
   - backup drivers  
   - score breakdown  
3. Dispatcher accepts or overrides  
4. Assignment sent to Driver App  
5. Codex logs:
   - `DISPATCH_SUGGESTED`  
   - `DISPATCH_ASSIGNED`  
   - `DISPATCH_OVERRIDE`

---

# 4. Driver App (Execution Layer)

### Purpose
Drivers execute the work and update real-time status.

### Key Functions
- View assigned loads  
- Update milestones  
- Upload POD  
- View earnings  
- Access credit  
- Track loyalty  

### Driver Flow
1. Driver receives assignment  
2. Driver updates:
   - `DRIVER_ARRIVED_PICKUP`  
   - `DRIVER_LOADED`  
   - `LOAD_IN_TRANSIT`  
   - `DRIVER_ARRIVED_DELIVERY`  
   - `POD_UPLOADED`  
3. Treasury triggers payout  
4. Codex logs all events

---

# 5. Frontend / Web Console

### Purpose
Unified interface for all user types.

### Key Functions
- Load Board UI  
- Dispatch Console  
- Ops Global Map  
- Driver Management  
- Partner Management  
- Treasury Dashboard  
- Compliance Dashboard  

### Flow
1. User logs in  
2. Frontend calls Dynasty OS API  
3. Data displayed in tables, cards, maps, timelines  
4. User actions trigger API calls  
5. API triggers Codex events

---

# 6. Full System Loop

### Step-by-step integration:

1. **Load Created** → Load Board updates → Codex logs  
2. **Dispatch Triggered** → AI suggests → Ops assigns  
3. **Driver Executes** → updates milestones → uploads POD  
4. **Delivery Completed** → Treasury calculates payout  
5. **Treasury Updates** → wallet, credit, rewards  
6. **Codex Anchors** → full operational memory  
7. **AI Improves** → learns from Codex data

# 8. Summary

The Load Board, Dispatch Engine, Driver App, and Frontend form a unified operational system:

- Load Board = visibility  
- Dispatch = intelligence  
- Driver App = execution  
- Treasury = financial flow  
- Codex = memory  

This integration enables the Dynasty OS to operate as a complete logistics operating system.

# Dynasty OS — Codex Event Taxonomy
## The Structured Event Dictionary for the Dynasty OS

Codex is the event spine of the Dynasty OS.  
Every action in the system emits a structured event that becomes part of the permanent operational record.

This document defines the **event categories**, **event names**, and **intended usage**.

---

# 1. Event Categories

Codex events are grouped into seven major categories:

1. **Load Events**  
2. **Dispatch Events**  
3. **Driver Events**  
4. **Compliance Events**  
5. **Treasury Events**  
6. **Governance Events**  
7. **Codex Events**  

Each category contains multiple event types.

---

# 2. Load Events

| Event Name | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `LOAD_CREATED` | A new load is created by shipper or ops. |
| `LOAD_UPDATED` | Load details are modified. |
| `LOAD_CANCELLED` | Load is cancelled before assignment. |
| `LOAD_IN_TRANSIT` | Load is actively moving. |
| `LOAD_DELIVERED` | Delivery completed. |
| `LOAD_EXCEPTION` | Delay, damage, or operational issue. |

---

# 3. Dispatch Events

| Event Name | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `DISPATCH_SUGGESTED` | AI provides driver suggestions. |
| `DISPATCH_ASSIGNED` | Driver is assigned to load. |
| `DISPATCH_OVERRIDE` | Human overrides AI suggestion. |
| `DISPATCH_ESCALATED` | Dispatch requires higher-level review. |

---

# 4. Driver Events

| `DRIVER_ARRIVED_PICKUP` | Driver reaches pickup location. |
| `DRIVER_LOADED` | Cargo loaded. |
| `DRIVER_DEPARTED` | Driver leaves pickup. |
| `DRIVER_ARRIVED_DELIVERY` | Driver reaches delivery location. |
| `POD_UPLOADED` | Proof of delivery submitted. |

---

| `CODEX_RECORD_CREATED` | A new event is stored. |
| `CODEX_ANCHORED` | A batch of events is anchored for integrity. |

---

# 9. Event Structure (Recommended)

Each event should follow a consistent structure:

```json
{
  "event_id": "uuid",
  "event_type": "LOAD_CREATED",
  "timestamp": "ISO-8601",
  "actor": "user/service",
  "entity": "load/driver/etc",
  "entity_id": "id",
  "payload": { ... },
  "metadata": { ... }
}
10. Purpose of the Taxonomy
This taxonomy ensures:

consistency

auditability

transparency

AI training quality

operational clarity

Codex is the memory of the Dynasty OS.
