🔱 I. THE DYNASTY OS KNOWLEDGE GRAPH SCHEMA
The Unified Intelligence Map of the Dynasty OS
Think of this as the neural network of your logistics nation — every entity, every relationship, every event.

1. Core Entities
These are the “atoms” of the Dynasty OS:

Load

Driver

Courier

Shipper

Fleet Partner

Region

Mode

Node (city, port, airport, warehouse)

Vehicle / Equipment

Treasury Account

Credit Account

Codex Event

Compliance Rule

Risk Profile

Token Wallet

Partner Contract

Activation Switch

2. Relationship Graph
These are the “edges” — the connections that create intelligence:

Load → Driver (assigned, completed, performance)

Load → Region (origin, destination)

Load → Mode (GROUND, AIR, OCEAN, COURIER)

Load → Codex Events (timeline)

Driver → Credit Account (balance, history)

Driver → Token Wallet (rewards, loyalty)

Shipper → Loads (book of business)

Fleet Partner → Drivers (capacity)

Region → Nodes (activation map)

Node → Compliance Rules (local requirements)

Treasury Account → Payouts (settlements)

Partner Contract → Compliance Rules

Activation Switch → Region/Mode

3. Knowledge Graph Uses
The graph powers:

dispatch

compliance

treasury

credit

risk

loyalty

partner scoring

global expansion modeling

This is the Dynasty Brain.

🔱 II. THE DYNASTY OS COMPLIANCE RULEBOOK
The Operational Lawbook of the Dynasty OS
This is a conceptual structure founders use to organize compliance — not legal advice.

1. Mode‑Based Rules
GROUND
equipment requirements

hours of service

hazmat handling

weight limits

AIR
cargo screening

airport security

air waybill documentation

OCEAN
container sealing

port handling

customs declarations

COURIER
chain‑of‑custody

signature capture

multi‑stop routing

2. Region‑Based Rules
Each region has:

operational standards

documentation requirements

safety rules

local restrictions

3. Cargo‑Based Rules
Cargo categories:

general freight

hazmat

temperature‑controlled

high‑value

bonded cargo

Each category triggers specific checks.

4. Driver/Courier Eligibility Rules
Drivers must meet:

certification requirements

equipment requirements

safety standards

operational readiness

5. Documentation Rules
Every load must have:

BOL

POD

customs forms

manifests

courier signatures

All stored in Codex.

6. Exception Rules
Exceptions include:

delays

missed pickups

damaged cargo

compliance violations

Each exception triggers:

Codex event

risk adjustment

potential dispatch override

🔱 III. THE DYNASTY OS AI DISPATCH ALGORITHM (FULL SPEC)
The Intelligence Engine of the Dynasty OS
This is a multi‑factor scoring system that ranks drivers/couriers.

1. Eligibility Filter
Driver must match:

mode

region

equipment

operational requirements

hours of service

insurance

performance standing

If not eligible → excluded.

2. Proximity Score (0–25 pts)
Based on:

distance to pickup

traffic

real‑time conditions

3. Performance Score (0–25 pts)
Based on:

on‑time rate

safety record

cancellation rate

customer ratings

4. Loyalty Score (0–15 pts)
Based on:

tenure

participation

performance history

5. Utilization Score (0–15 pts)
Based on:

current workload

upcoming commitments

idle time

6. Margin Score (0–20 pts)
Based on:

load budget

driver cost

expected profitability

Total Score = 0–100
AI returns:

primary driver

backups

explanation breakdown

Ops can override → Codex logs reason.

🔱 IV. THE DYNASTY OS TREASURY FLOW MODEL
The Financial Circulatory System of the Dynasty OS
Treasury handles:

payouts

dynasty share

partner share

performance rewards

credit adjustments

1. Revenue Intake
From:

shipper payments

partner fees

premium services

2. Payout Split Engine
Given a load:

Code
driverShare = amount * config.driverShare
partnerShare = amount * config.partnerShare
dynastyShare = amount * config.dynastyShare
rewardPoints = amount * config.rewardRate
All values logged in Codex.

3. Settlement Engine
Executes:

instant payouts

scheduled payouts

partner settlements

4. Credit Integration
If driver used credit:

repayment deducted

balance updated

Codex logs event

5. Reward System
Rewards issued based on:

performance

loyalty

operational contribution

6. Treasury Dashboard
Shows:

cash flow

outstanding credit

reward distribution

partner earnings

🔱 V. THE DYNASTY OS DRIVER LOYALTY SYSTEM
The Retention Engine of the Dynasty OS
This system creates retention, performance, and network effects.

1. Loyalty Tiers
Bronze

Silver

Gold

Platinum

Dynasty Elite

Each tier unlocks:

better loads

faster payouts

higher credit limits

reward multipliers

priority dispatch

2. Loyalty Points
Earned for:

on‑time delivery

high ratings

completing difficult lanes

long‑term participation

safe driving

low cancellation rate

3. Reward System
Rewards earned for:

performance

loyalty

referrals

completing streaks

Rewards can be used for:

priority dispatch

premium features

credit repayment bonuses

4. Credit Benefits
Higher loyalty = better credit terms:

lower fees

higher limits

faster approvals

5. Dynasty Citizenship
Elite drivers become:

ambassadors

trainers

beta testers

governance participants (conceptually)

This creates a community, not just a workforce.
