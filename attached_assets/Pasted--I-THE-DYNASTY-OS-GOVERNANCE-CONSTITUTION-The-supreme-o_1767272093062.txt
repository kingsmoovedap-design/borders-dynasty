🔱 I. THE DYNASTY OS GOVERNANCE CONSTITUTION
The supreme operating principles of a sovereign logistics nation
This Constitution defines how the Dynasty OS governs:

operations

compliance

treasury

credit

dispatch

drivers

partners

Codex

global expansion

It is built on seven articles.

ARTICLE I — Sovereignty of the Codex
Codex is the supreme ledger.

Every action becomes a Codex event.

No event can be deleted or altered.

Codex is the legal memory of the Dynasty.

Codex defines truth, compliance, and accountability.

If it is not in Codex, it did not happen.

ARTICLE II — Separation of Powers
The Dynasty OS separates authority into four branches:

1. Operational Branch
Runs logistics, dispatch, drivers, and daily execution.

2. Treasury Branch
Manages payouts, dynasty share, token rewards, and credit.

3. Compliance Branch
Ensures legal, regulatory, and safety alignment.

4. Governance Branch (Omega)
Controls:

region activation

mode activation

partner onboarding

global expansion

Codex anchoring cadence

Each branch is independent but interconnected through Codex.

ARTICLE III — Activation Authority
Only Omega may activate:

modes (GROUND, AIR, OCEAN, COURIER)

regions (NA, EU, APAC, LATAM)

nodes (cities, ports, airports)

Every activation is logged:

MODE_ACTIVATED

REGION_ACTIVATED

NODE_ACTIVATED

GLOBAL_LAUNCH_TRIGGERED

This creates a global orchestration map.

ARTICLE IV — Dispatch Integrity
Dispatch decisions must be:

explainable

auditable

reversible

compliant

logged

AI may recommend.
Humans may override.
Codex records both.

ARTICLE V — Driver & Courier Rights
Drivers and couriers have:

transparent payouts

access to credit

token rewards

clear expectations

safety protections

dispute resolution

They are the citizens of the Dynasty OS.

ARTICLE VI — Treasury Transparency

deterministic

auditable

anchored in Codex

compliant with regional rules
