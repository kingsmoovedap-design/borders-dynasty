# Dual-Token Overview – BSC and BDC

This document summarizes the dual-token structure of the Borders Dynasty ecosystem.

---

## 1. Tokens

### 1.1 Borders Sovereign Coin (BSC)

- Chain: BNB Smart Chain (BSC)
- Type: Upgradeable ERC-20-compatible token (BEP-20)
- Role:
  - Operational Web3 DeFi core
  - Logistics rewards and incentives
  - Internal denominated unit (conceptual)

### 1.2 Borders Dynasty Coin (BDC)

- Chain: Arbitrum One
- Type: Upgradeable ERC-20-compatible token
- Role:
  - Governance and alignment layer
  - Long-term protocol-level signaling
  - Conceptual influence over configuration and incentive rules

---

## 2. Layering

- BSC = Operational Layer (flows)
- BDC = Governance Layer (direction)
- Codex = Cross-Layer Event Spine
- Logistics OS = Real-World Operational System

---

## 3. Interaction Framework (Conceptual)

- BSC activity generates Codex events and logistics data.
- Codex data informs governance topics for BDC holders.
- BDC governance results influence application parameters that shape BSC-based flows.
- Treasury modules may conceptually manage both BSC and BDC and log actions into Codex.

This framework is technical and conceptual only, with no financial guarantees.
