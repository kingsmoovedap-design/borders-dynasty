# Dynasty OS – Dual‑Token Architecture

This document defines the conceptual architecture of the Dynasty OS dual‑token system:

- **Token A – Dynasty Utility (BSC)**  
- **Token B – Dynasty Governance (Major L1)**  

Together they form a unified economic and governance spine for the Logistics Dynasty.

---

## 1. Token A – Dynasty Utility (BSC)

### 1.1 Chain & Standard
- Chain: BNB Smart Chain (BSC)
- Standard: BEP‑20 (EVM‑compatible)

### 1.2 Purpose
- Operational utility
- In‑app economic fuel
- Driver & partner rewards
- Logistics‑native incentives

### 1.3 Core Functions (Conceptual)
- Pay in‑app fees
- Earn for completing loads or contributing to network
- Stake for operational benefits (routing priority, marketplace placement)
- Participate in loyalty and rewards programs

---

## 2. Token B – Dynasty Governance (Major Chain)

### 2.1 Chain & Standard
- Chain: Major L1 (e.g. Ethereum mainnet or similar)
- Standard: ERC‑20‑style governance/reserve asset

### 2.2 Purpose
- Governance & strategic alignment
- Long‑term staking and commitment
- Prestige & status within the Dynasty ecosystem
- Treasury reserve / “crown” asset (conceptual)

### 2.3 Core Functions (Conceptual)
- Signaling preferences on protocol parameters
- Staking to access advanced analytics or decision layers
- Participation in governance processes
- Representing long‑term alignment with the Logistics Dynasty

---

## 3. Role Separation & Harmony

Token A and Token B are intentionally non‑identical:

- **Token A (BSC):** High‑frequency logistics usage, rewards, internal fees.
- **Token B (L1):** Low‑frequency, high‑commitment governance and prestige.

Harmony principles:

1. Clear separation of purpose
2. Shared Codex event spine
3. Shared treasury view
4. Unified narrative and UI presence

---

## 4. Economic Interaction (Conceptual)

### 4.1 Dual Staking (Conceptual)
- Stake Token A → unlock operational perks, enhanced rewards.
- Stake Token B → unlock governance participation, higher‑tier insights, and potential multipliers on Token A actions.

### 4.2 Treasury Co‑Presence
- Treasury logically tracks both Token A and Token B.
- Codex logs all treasury movements, swaps, and allocations.

### 4.3 Logistics Binding
- Token A ties directly to load completion, route success, and driver metrics.
- Token B ties to activation of new regions, modes, and strategic parameters.

---

## 5. Codex Integration

Both tokens emit structured Codex events:

- Token A: operational and reward side
- Token B: governance, staking, and cross‑chain side

Codex provides:

- Auditability
- Narrative continuity
- Intelligence for future decisions
