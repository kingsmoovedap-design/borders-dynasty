# Dual Coin System – Borders Sovereign Coin (BSC) & Borders Dynasty Coin (BDC)

## 1. Overview

The Dynasty OS uses a dual‑coin conceptual architecture:

- Borders Sovereign Coin (BSC) – operational, accounting, and logistics unit on BNB Smart Chain (BSC).
- Borders Dynasty Coin (BDC) – governance and alignment token on a major L1 chain.

This document defines their roles, interactions, and conceptual integration.

## 2. Borders Sovereign Coin (BSC)

- Chain: BNB Smart Chain (EVM‑compatible)
- Standard: BEP‑20 (ERC‑20–style interface)
- Total Supply: 1,000,000 BSC
- Contract: 0xE6F7...B2D9

### 2.1 Role

- Internal unit of account for logistics and payouts.
- Rewards for drivers and partners.
- Treasury reference unit for the ecosystem.

### 2.2 Declared Value (Conceptual)

Internally, 1 BSC is treated as equivalent to 1 unit of notional USD value for calculations and display. This is a documentation convention, not a guarantee, peg, or financial promise.

## 3. Borders Dynasty Coin (BDC)

- Chain: Major L1 (ERC‑20–compatible)
- Role: Governance, long‑term alignment, prestige.
- Functions:
  - Staking for governance access and advanced tools.
  - Alignment with long‑term protocol development.

## 4. Interaction Between BSC and BDC

- BDC staking can conceptually unlock better multipliers or access in the BSC‑denominated logistics world.
- BSC activity generates operational data that informs governance discussions by BDC holders.
- Treasury may track holdings of both BSC and BDC and log movement in Codex.

## 5. Codex Integration

All major token actions (rewards, treasury movements, governance milestones) are recorded as Codex events, ensuring transparency and continuity.
